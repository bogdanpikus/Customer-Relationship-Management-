## Customer Relationship Management (CRM)
CRM is a forever free and open-source project. The application is completely autonomous, does not depend on the internet, does not send us any confidential information, we do not even know about you. 

The application assists you in organising your sales, your customers, your products, their locations, and information about them.
Everything in one place. From simple storage to structured content filtering. The application also provides the ability to analyse your data, such as sales, buyers, costs, ABC analysis, loss analysis, income analysis, and sales performance analysis for your specified marketplaces
## For your business

## The idea of creation
The application solves a key problemâ€”the lack of confidentiality and security in cloud-based CRM systems, where information is stored on third-party servers under external control.

I didn't want anyone to know about my customers or my confidential information. I didn't want anyone to be able to disconnect me from the system, restrict my access, or terminate our working relationship for some external reason or geopolitical issue. 

I didn't want to be monitored. I didn't want to be dependent on other people's competence. Initially, I am doing this exclusively for myself, for the purpose of conducting a sales business.
